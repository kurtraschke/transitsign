Server:

* Proper packaging: the modules we need are async, express, mongoskin, redmark, request, socket.io, xml2js, winston, winston-mongodb
* Wherever we use xml2js, we need a parser.on('error', ...) call.
* Add user interface for viewing logs.

Client:

* High priority: better font.  Helvetica may seem appropriate, but it's actually bad for
  signage applications like this as it's prone to halation problems.  We'll try Droid Sans for now.
* More robust marquee (see notes in source).
* Fix reconnect bug (on reconnect, the initialization routine runs again, but it's not .
* When disconnected, we should have a full-screen overlay saying "sign out of service" with some explanatory text.
* Related: the server should have a way to tell the client that data has gone stale.
* Improve configuration mechanism.

Both:

* CoffeeScript?  Is it worth it?
* If not, at least compile/minify the JS.

Other data sources:

* BART ETD (good for demonstrating modularity)
* Air quality?
