Server:

* Real-time stats: last fetch for each source, number of clients connected,
  number of calls per API per day, etc.
* We should probably set an appropriate User-agent on requests.

Client:

* High priority: better font.  Helvetica may seem appropriate, but it's 
  actually bad for signage applications like this as it's prone to halation
  problems.  We'll try Droid Sans for now.
* We need better icons for rail services, to differentiate commuter rail
  from subways from trams.  Hopefully some good will come of this:
  http://iconathon.org/content/new-york-city
* Time format should be customizable.
* Weather should be made generic (see discussion of sources, below).
* Presently we display as many bus predictions as will fit, regardless of time.
  We may want to only display predictions with in a certain interval (one hour,
  for example), or otherwise improve formatting for distant predictions--show 
  them as "1:24" rather than "84 minutes" or "at 4:30" (using the absolute time).
* If there's text in a bus prediction that is too long, it overflows
  and ruins the layout, whether it's one column or two.
  This would be helped by agencies not using destination names like
  "South - 142 Avenue Rd Express towards Highway 401 - Extra Fare Required",
  but for now we have to work around it.
  For the record, the route destination does not need to contain the route
  number and title, nor fare information.  The destination above could be 
  revised as "South towards Highway 401" without losing information.
* Improve configuration mechanism: we now store the configuration in
  MongoDB, which is a good step, but we also need a GUI configurator
  to generate the configuration documents and save them to the database.

Both:

* Only update services when they are actually operating;
  communicate on the sign when the last train has gone, etc.
* Track the last update for each source, and communicate to the sign
  that the data has gone stale.

Other data sources:

* Air quality (http://www.airnowgateway.org/, requires registration
  and is excessively bureaucratic)
* Weather forecast (http://www.weather.gov/forecasts/xml/)
* Canadian weather (http://dd.weatheroffice.gc.ca/)
* Australian weather (ftp://ftp2.bom.gov.au/anon/gen/fwo)
* The UK Met Office does not release data.  There will be no weather for London.
* FAA air traffic delays (might be good for intermodal transit centers
  at airports or which provide service to an airport):
  http://www.fly.faa.gov/flyfaa/xmlAirportStatus.jsp
* Considering that MTA NYCT will probably be using SIRI or a SIRI-like API to
  expose data from the full-scale Bus CIS project once it goes live, we should
  probably support SIRI as a generic API. 
* See CITIES for more on transit data sources.
