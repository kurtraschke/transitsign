Server:

* Logging! (use winston and winston-mongodb)
* Sometimes we send an empty document to MongoDB, and this upsets it.  Fix.
* Proper packaging: the modules we need are async, express, mongoskin, redmark, request, socket.io, xml2js.

Client:

* High priority: better font.  Helvetica may seem appropriate, but it's actually bad for
  signage applications like this as it's prone to halation

* More robust marquee.
* Fix reconnect bug.
* When disconnected, we should have a full-screen overlay saying "sign out of service" with some explanatory text.
* Related: the server should have a way to tell the client that data has gone stale.
* Improve configuration mechanism.

Both:

* CoffeeScript?  Is it worth it?
* If not, at least compile/minify the JS.
