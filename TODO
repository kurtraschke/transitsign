Server:

* Capped collection for logs.
* Add user interface for viewing logs.
* Real-time stats: last fetch for each source, number of clients connected,
  number of calls per API per day, etc.

Client:

* High priority: better font.  Helvetica may seem appropriate, but it's 
  actually bad for signage applications like this as it's prone to halation
  problems.  We'll try Droid Sans for now.
* Fix reconnect bug (on reconnect, the initialization routine runs again,
  but it's not designed for that).
* Related: the server should have a way to tell the client that data has
  gone stale.
* Improve configuration mechanism.

Both:

* Only update services when they are actually operating;
  communicate on the sign when the last train has gone, etc.

Other data sources:

* Air quality (http://www.airnowgateway.org/, requires registration
  and is excessively bureaucratic)
* Weather forecast (http://www.weather.gov/forecasts/xml/)
* FAA air traffic delays (might be good for intermodal transit centers
  at airports or which provide service to an airport):
