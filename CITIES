Cities which have been tested and for which there are sample configurations:

* Washington, D.C.
  * Metrorail predictions and incidents
  * Metrobus predictions
  * ART predictions (Connexionz)
  * DC Circulator predictions (NextBus)
  * Capital Bikeshare status (PBSC)
* San Francisco
  * BART predictions and incidents
  * Muni predictions (NextBus)
* Portland
  * TriMet predictions
* Toronto
  * TTC bus and streetcar predictions (NextBus)
    (Obviously, there's no rail data.)
  * BIXI Toronto status
* Boston
  * Hubway status (PBSC, http://www.thehubway.com/data/stations/bikeStations.xml)
  * MBTA bus predictions (NextBus)
  * MBTA rail predictions (proprietary API)
* Melbourne

  * Yarra Trams (undocumented JSON API, see http://extranetdev.yarratrams.com.au/pidsservicejson/)

Cities which should work, but have not been tested:

* Any other city which uses NextBus or Connexionz for AVL
* Any other city with a B-cycle or PBSC bike sharing system

Cities which need coding done for one or more proprietary APIs:

* Chicago
  * B-cycle status (already done)
  * BusTracker (uses the Clever API; need to write a generic module for it)
  * TrainTracker (proprietary API)
  * PACE (uses AVL from Trapeze (ex Siemens) which appears not to have an API)
* Minneapolis
  * Nice Ride status (PBSC, http://secure.niceridemn.org/data2/bikeStations.xml)
  * Metro Transit predictions (no official API, vendor unknown, see screen-scraper at https://github.com/cmaul/MetroTransit-API)
* London
  * Barclays Cycle Hire (PBSC, requires registration!)
  * Underground predictions (custom API for Trackernet)
  * DLR predictions (no official API available)
