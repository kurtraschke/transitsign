Cities which have been tested and for which there are sample configurations:

* Washington, D.C.
  * Metrorail predictions and incidents
  * Metrobus predictions
  * ART predictions (Connexionz)
  * DC Circulator predictions (NextBus)
  * Capital Bikeshare status (PBSC)
* San Francisco
  * BART predictions and incidents
  * Muni predictions (NextBus)

Cities which should work, but have not been tested:

* Toronto
  * TTC bus and streetcar predictions (NextBus)
    (Obviously, there's no rail data.)
  * BIXI Toronto status
* Any other city which uses NextBus, Connexionz
* Any other city with a B-cycle, or PBSC bike sharing system

Cities which need coding done for a proprietary API:

* Chicago
  * B-cycle status (already done)
  * BusTracker (uses the Clever API; need to write a generic module for it)
  * TrainTracker (custom API)
* Boston
  * Hubway status (a PBSC system)
  * MBTA bus predictions (NextBus)
  * MBTA rail predictions (custom API)
